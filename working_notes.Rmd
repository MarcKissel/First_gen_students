#get the data i need
i am going to try to dl the data from here
https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/data 
i want table 033 for each year
here is 2017:
https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/data
here is 2016:
https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsf18304/data.cfm
here is 2015 
https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17306/data.cfm 
here is 2014
https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2016/nsf16300/data-tables.cfm

https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2016/nsf16300/data/tab33.xlsx

here is 2013:
https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/sed/2013/data-tables.cfm

https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/sed/2013/data/tab33.xlsx

so it looks like not standard location

also note, 2011 and before is archived
so 2011:
https://wayback.archive-it.org/5902/20181003230029/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/sed/2011/

2010:
https://wayback.archive-it.org/5902/20181003231120/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/sed/2010/SED_2010.zip

question now is how many years do we have access to?


## ok, so this isn't going to be easy. maybe best bet is not to do script and just d/l table 33 for each avilbale year
